malSniffer
Author: Luigi Malomo

BUILD:
	command: make
	cleanup: make clean
	required libs: pcap, rrdtool

	The program should compile on both Mac OS 10.5 and Linux (tested on Ubuntu 9.04)


USAGE:
       malSniffer [-v] [-b] [-f] [-i <interface>] [-r [<rrdfile>]] [-p <pcap_file>]
       -v : verbose mode
       -b : if supported enable bidirectional monitoring mode (MAC address based)
       -f : enable flow aggregation (flows are emitted on stdout)
       -i <interface> : capture from specified device
       -r <rrdfile> : store statistics on specified file (if doesn't exist will be created)
       	              if -b option is set the program attempts to create two files: "in_<rrdfile>" and "out_<rrdfile>"
       -p <pcap_file> : [BENCHMARK PURPOSE ONLY] capture offline from specified file (can be used only with -f and -v options)


EXAMPLE:
	sudo ./malSniffer -v -b -r data.rrd -f

	The command launch the program that lets the user choose which interface to capture on.
	Then creates two rrd files: in_data.rrd and out_data.rrd.
	Periodically (every 10 seconds) the program updates the databases witch collected data and
	(every 60 seconds) emits the flows printing them on stdout.


ADDONS:
	graph.sh
	
	Execute the script to generate graphs from rrd files.
